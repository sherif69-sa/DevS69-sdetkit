# Roadmap

See the repo roadmap in `ROADMAP.md` for product and release direction.

## Security and maintenance operations cadence

To keep security and maintenance work visible and actionable, the repo runs an automated checklist and enhancement intake process:

- Weekly security checklist issue is maintained by `.github/workflows/security-maintenance-bot.yml`.
- Security triage should include Dependabot, Code Scanning, and Actions workflow status review.
- At least one open enhancement intake issue should exist and be labeled with `enhancement` plus a `priority:*` label.

## Enhancement tracking policy

When an enhancement is identified from customer or user feedback:

1. Create/confirm an issue labeled `enhancement`.
2. Add one priority label: `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, or `priority:low`.
3. Link the enhancement issue or PR back to this roadmap page and the main `ROADMAP.md` where appropriate.
