# Top-10 GitHub Strategy for DevS69 sdetkit

## What this repository is for

DevS69 sdetkit is a **production-ready SDET and engineering reliability toolkit** focused on:

- CLI-first quality and security workflows (`doctor`, `repo`, `security`, `policy`, `report`, `ops`).
- Deterministic API automation (`apiget`, cassette replay, async API client helpers).
- Enterprise-ready governance and evidence generation for CI/CD adoption.
- A docs + portal experience that lowers onboarding time for contributors and adopters.

In short: this repo helps teams convert testing, QA, and repo operations into repeatable, auditable workflows.

## Current strengths to amplify

1. **Breadth of capability**: health diagnostics, policy, security gates, repo auditing, agent workflows.
2. **Strong documentation surface** with MkDocs and focused guides.
3. **Large automated test surface** supporting confidence and contributor safety.
4. **Actionable CLI UX** that maps well to both local and CI use cases.

These strengths are the right base for growth; the next step is packaging, discoverability, and contributor velocity.

## The top-10 objective (realistic framing)

"Top 10 on GitHub" is highly competitive and broad. A practical, measurable goal is:

- Become **top-tier in the QA/SDET + DevEx automation niche**.
- Reach strong stars/forks/download momentum through repeatable launch motions.
- Build a recognizable category position: "enterprise-grade SDET operations CLI."

## 90-day execution plan

### Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Positioning + conversion (daily execution)

This phase now runs as a **day-by-day operating plan**. When we say "work Day 1," we execute that day’s checklist in full and publish the artifacts before moving on.

#### Day 1–30 sprint plan

- **Day 1 — Core positioning refresh:** finalize one-line value proposition, role-based audience block, and top CTA in README.
- **Day 2 — 60-second demo path:** add a copy-paste command flow with expected output snippets.
- **Day 3 — Proof artifacts:** capture and publish 3 command screenshots/GIFs (`doctor`, `repo audit`, `security`).
- **Day 4 — Comparison clarity:** publish "sdetkit vs ad-hoc scripts" and "vs lint-only pipelines" guidance.
- **Day 5 — Platform onboarding:** add Linux/macOS/Windows setup snippets.
- **Day 6 — Conversion QA:** test README links/anchors and remove friction points.
- **Day 7 — Weekly review #1:** publish what shipped, what moved KPIs, and next-week focus.

- **Day 8 — Contributor funnel start:** create 10 curated `good first issue` tasks.
- **Day 9 — Contribution templates:** improve issue/PR templates for fast triage.
- **Day 10 — First-contribution checklist:** add guided path in contributing docs.
- **Day 11 — Docs navigation tune-up:** make top user journeys one-click from docs home.
- **Day 12 — Use-case page #1:** startup/small-team workflow landing page.
- **Day 13 — Use-case page #2:** enterprise/regulated workflow landing page.
- **Day 14 — Weekly review #2:** report traffic, stars, discussions, and blocker fixes.

- **Day 15 — Integration recipe #1:** GitHub Actions quickstart with minimal config.
- **Day 16 — Integration recipe #2:** GitLab CI quickstart.
- **Day 17 — Integration recipe #3:** Jenkins quickstart.
- **Day 18 — Reliability evidence pack:** publish sample outputs/artifacts bundle.
- **Day 19 — Social launch kit:** prepare short post templates + visuals for recurring promotion.
- **Day 20 — Release narrative:** produce clear changelog storytelling for non-maintainers.
- **Day 21 — Weekly review #3:** track conversion improvements and external contributor response.

- **Day 22 — Trust signal upgrade:** tighten security/reliability badge and policy visibility.
- **Day 23 — FAQ and objections:** answer adoption blockers ("when to use", "when not to use").
- **Day 24 — Onboarding time reduction:** optimize path to first successful command under 3 minutes.
- **Day 25 — Community activation:** open roadmap-voting discussion and collect feedback.
- **Day 26 — External contribution push:** spotlight open starter tasks publicly.
- **Day 27 — KPI audit:** compare baseline vs current (stars/week, CTR, discussions, PRs).
- **Day 28 — Weekly review #4:** document wins, misses, and corrective actions.

- **Day 29 — Phase-1 hardening:** close stale docs gaps and polish top entry pages.
- **Day 30 — Phase-1 wrap + handoff:** publish a full report and lock Phase-2 backlog.

#### Phase-1 weekly deliverables (must ship)

- 1 visible documentation or onboarding improvement.
- 1 distribution artifact (post/video/GIF/release highlight).
- 1 contributor-funnel improvement (issues/templates/checklists).
- 1 KPI snapshot update shared with the team.

**Phase-1 target metrics:**
- README-to-first-command conversion improves week-over-week.
- At least one external contributor PR by Day 30.
- Measurable increase in stars/week and discussions/week by end of phase.

### Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Adoption loops

- Create weekly release cadence with visible changelog highlights.
- Publish 4 short demo videos/GIFs (doctor, repo audit, security gate, cassette replay).
- Add "production templates" bundle and announce on social channels.
- Start a "Repo Reliability Playbook" series (4 posts) linking back to docs.

**Target metrics:**
- Increased recurring traffic and stars/week.
- More issue discussions from real users.

### Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Ecosystem + trust

- Introduce community office hours (monthly) and roadmap voting issues.
- Add integration examples with common CI providers and automation tools.
- Publish benchmark-style case studies:
  - reduced flaky checks,
  - faster incident triage,
  - tighter policy compliance.
- Add contributor recognition board and release credits.

**Target metrics:**
- Sustained star growth and external PR ratio.
- Re-usage of templates in downstream repos.

## Prioritized backlog (highest impact first)

1. **README conversion optimization** (clear CTA + role-based onboarding).
2. **Demo artifacts** (GIF/video snapshots with CLI outcomes).
3. **Integration recipes** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins examples).
4. **Beginner-friendly contribution funnel** (starter issues + templates).
5. **Use-case landing pages** (startup, regulated org, monorepo platform team).
6. **Community rhythm** (release notes + monthly updates).
7. **Trust signals** (security posture badge section + reliability KPIs).

## KPIs to track weekly

- GitHub stars/week and stars per 1,000 page views.
- README click-through rate to docs and portal.
- Time-to-first-successful-command for new users.
- Number of external contributors and merged external PRs.
- Docs pages with highest exits (to improve onboarding friction).
- Issues opened vs resolved and median response time.

## "Top-10" scorecard

Track progress with a simple monthly score (0-5 each):

- Clarity of value proposition.
- Onboarding friction.
- Community activity.
- Reliability trust signals.
- Integrations breadth.
- Documentation depth and discoverability.
- Release cadence consistency.

A score of **28+/35 for 3 consecutive months** indicates strong category leadership momentum.
